# Complete Incident Reporting Workflow Documentation

## üîÑ **End-to-End Incident Resolution Process**

### Overview
The Basey Municipality Traffic Enforcement System follows a complete workflow from public reporting to final resolution, ensuring accountability and proper follow-through on all reported incidents.

## üì± **Phase 1: Public Incident Reporting**

### Public User Actions
1. **Access Report Feature**: General public uses "Report an Incident" interface
2. **Submit Details**: Provides comprehensive incident information:
   - Violation type (fare overcharge, reckless driving, etc.)
   - Vehicle details (plate number, type, description)
   - Location and time of incident
   - Detailed description of misconduct
   - Evidence (photos, videos if available)
   - Contact information for follow-up

### System Processing
- **Initial Status**: Report enters system as `"PENDING"`
- **Assignment**: Automatically routed to enforcer queue
- **Notification**: Enforcers alerted to new public reports
- **Reference ID**: Unique incident ID generated for tracking

```
Public Report ‚Üí Status: PENDING ‚Üí Enforcer Queue
```

## üëÆ **Phase 2: Enforcer Investigation & Action**

### Enforcer Responsibilities
1. **Review Report**: Examine public incident submission details
2. **Field Investigation**: Locate and verify the reported violation
3. **Issue Ticket**: Use integrated reporting system to create official ticket
4. **Penalty Calculation**: System auto-calculates based on offense history

### Ticket Issuance Process
- **Violation Confirmation**: Enforcer confirms public report accuracy
- **Offense Lookup**: System checks vehicle violation history
- **Penalty Assignment**: Municipal ordinance penalties applied:
  - 1st Offense: ‚Ç±500
  - 2nd Offense: ‚Ç±1,000
  - 3rd Offense: ‚Ç±1,500
- **Ticket Generation**: Official citation issued to violator

```
Pending Report ‚Üí Investigation ‚Üí Ticket Issued ‚Üí Status: TICKET_ISSUED
```

## üí∞ **Phase 3: Payment & Resolution**

### Payment Requirement
- **Mandatory Payment**: Incident cannot be resolved until penalty is paid
- **Payment Status Tracking**: System monitors payment completion
- **Status Updates**: Automatic status changes based on payment

### Resolution Criteria
An incident is marked as `"RESOLVED"` ONLY when:
1. ‚úÖ **Ticket Issued**: Official citation created by enforcer
2. ‚úÖ **Payment Received**: Fine/penalty amount fully paid by violator
3. ‚úÖ **System Confirmation**: Payment verified and recorded

### Status Progression
```

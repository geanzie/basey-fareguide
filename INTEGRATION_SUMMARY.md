  - ðŸ“‹ **Full Incident Report**: For complex situations requiring investigation
  - ðŸš‘ **Emergency Report**: For critical safety situations

### 2. **Smart Context Switching**
- **Dynamic Form Adaptation**: Form fields and requirements change based on selected mode
- **Data Preservation**: Switching modes preserves entered information
- **Visual Indicators**: Color coding and icons help enforcers choose the right mode
- **Context Help**: Descriptive text guides proper usage

### 3. **Enhanced Automation**
- **Auto-Population**:

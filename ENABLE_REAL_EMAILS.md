# 📧 Enable Real Email Sending

## ✅ Changes Made

I've updated your email configuration to **actually send emails** instead of just logging to console.

### What Changed:

1. **Email Logic Updated** (`src/lib/email.ts`)
   - Removed the `NODE_ENV === 'development'` check that was blocking emails
   - Now sends real emails when `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured
   - Still logs to console in development for debugging
   - Falls back to console-only if API key is missing

2. **Environment Configuration** (`.env.local`)
   - Set `EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's testing email)
   - Your API key is already configured: `re_ScczQt6K_JkSjdhi8dGkCB7KA7bthrNSp`

## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Dev Server
```powershell
# In your terminal, stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Password Reset
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/request-reset
2. Enter: `ocenagener@gmail.com`
3. Click "Send OTP Code"

### Step 3: Check Email
- **Check your inbox**: ocenagener@gmail.com
- **Check spam folder** (Resend emails sometimes land in spam first)
- **Terminal**: You'll see "SENDING EMAIL" instead of "Development Mode"

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### If Email Doesn't Arrive:

1. **Check Spam Folder** - Resend emails often land in spam initially
2. **Verify API Key** - Make sure key is valid at https://resend.com/api-keys
3. **Check Resend Logs** - Go to https://resend.com/emails to see delivery status
4. **Rate Limits** - You have 100 emails/day on free tier

### Using Testing Email

`onboarding@resend.dev` is Resend's testing sender:
- ✅ Works immediately (no domain verification needed)
- ✅ Perfect for development
- ⚠️ May land in spam folder
- ⚠️ Not recommended for production

### Delivery Time
- Usually arrives within **5-10 seconds**
- Can take up to 1 minute during high traffic

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Email Still Not Sending?

1. **Restart dev server** after changing .env.local
2. **Check API key** is correct (no extra spaces)
3. **Check Resend dashboard**: https://resend.com/emails
4. **Verify email address** exists and is accessible

### Still Seeing Console-Only Mode?

Make sure your `.env.local` has:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_ScczQt6K_JkSjdhi8dGkCB7KA7bthrNSp
EMAIL_FROM=onboarding@resend.dev
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

**Terminal shows:**
```
📧 SENDING EMAIL (Development Mode)
```

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "A 6-digit OTP code has been sent to your email address.",
  "email": "o***r@gmail.com"
}
```

**Email arrives in:** Gmail inbox or spam folder

2. **Test password reset** with ocenagener@gmail.com
3. **Check email inbox** (and spam!)

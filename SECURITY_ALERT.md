# üö® SECURITY WARNING: API Keys Exposed! üö®

## Immediate Actions Required:

### 1. **REVOKE CURRENT API KEY IMMEDIATELY**
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
- Find your current API key: `AIzaSyAGVaHkxMmi1IqQ5ZfNb6fi9-Gy7-3mdMI`
- **REVOKE/DELETE IT NOW** - it's been exposed in console logs and could be harvested

### 2. **Create New API Key with Restrictions**
```bash
# Go to Google Cloud Console > APIs & Credentials
# Create new API key
# Add these restrictions:

Application restrictions:
- HTTP referrers (web sites)
- Add: http://localhost:3000/*
- Add: https://yourdomain.com/* (for production)

API restrictions:
- Maps JavaScript API
- Places API  
- Geocoding API
```

### 3. **Update Environment Variables**
Replace in `.env.local`:
```bash
# OLD - COMPROMISED (REMOVE)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyAGVaHkxMmi1IqQ5ZfNb6fi9-Gy7-3mdMI

# NEW - RESTRICTED KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_NEW_RESTRICTED_KEY_HERE
```

### 4. **Security Best Practices Implemented**

#### ‚úÖ Content Security Policy Fixed
- Added Google Maps domains to CSP
- Maintains security while allowing maps

#### ‚úÖ API Endpoints Created
- `/api/enforcer/notifications`
- `/api/enforcer/dashboard` 
- `/api/enforcer/notifications/[id]/read`

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why API Keys Get Exposed

**Client-side environment variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_*) are:**
- Bundled into the client JavaScript
- Visible in browser DevTools
- Included in console logs
- **NOT SECRET** - anyone can see them

**This is NORMAL but requires proper API key restrictions!**

### 5. **Monitoring Setup**

Set up Google Cloud monitoring to detect unusual API usage:
- Enable API key usage alerts
- Set daily usage limits
- Monitor for unauthorized domains

### 6. **Production Security Checklist**

- [ ] API key restricted to specific domains
- [ ] Daily usage quotas set
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] CSP headers properly configured
- [ ] No sensitive data in console logs
- [ ] Regular API key rotation schedule

## Why This Happened

The Google Maps JavaScript API requires the API key to be accessible client-side, which means it will always be visible to users. This is by design and not a flaw - the security comes from:

1. **Domain restrictions** - Key only works on specified domains
2. **API restrictions** - Key only works with specified APIs
3. **Usage quotas** - Prevents abuse even if key is misused
4. **Monitoring** - Alerts when unusual usage detected

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATELY** revoke the exposed key
2. Create new restricted key
3. Update `.env.local` 
4. Test that maps still work
5. Set up monitoring in Google Cloud Console

**The new enforcer features will work properly once the API endpoints are accessible and the CSP issues are resolved.**

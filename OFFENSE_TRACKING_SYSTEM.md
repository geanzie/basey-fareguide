- **Registered Vehicle Selection**: Auto-populates violation history when selecting from registered vehicles
- **Manual Entry Support**: Fetches history when manually entering plate numbers
- **Dynamic Updates**: Penalty recalculates in real-time as data changes

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Structures
```typescript
interface ViolationHistory {
  id: string
  plateNumber: string
  violationType: string
  violationDate: string
  penaltyAmount: number
  status: 'PAID' | 'UNPAID' | 'PENDING'
}

interface IncidentReportForm {
  // ... existing fields
  offenseCount: number           // Number of previous violations
  previousOffenses: ViolationHistory[] // Complete violation history
}
```

### Penalty Calculation Logic
```typescript
const getOffensePenalty = (offenseCount: number): number => {
  switch (offenseCount + 1) { // +1 for current offense
    case 1: return 500   // 1st Offense
    case 2: return 1000  // 2nd Offense  
    case 3: return 1500  // 3rd Offense
    default: return 1500 // Subsequent violations
  }
}
```
